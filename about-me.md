<br>
ðŸ‘‹ Hey there!

Iâ€™m Anish, a Software Engineer, and I'm very curious about everything in life. I like to read a lot, delving into topics ranging from ancient history to the frontiers of technology. I enjoy contemplating ideas deeply, and I strive to understand why things are the way they are.

Having called India, the US, and currently Canada home, my experiences have fueled a diverse range of thoughts, interests, ideas, values, and beliefs. This blog serves as a platform where I share ideas, thoughts, and invaluable learnings.

The internet has been a generous source of knowledge for me, and this blog is my way of paying it forward. Iâ€™m eager to engage with youâ€”whether you agree with or challenge the ideas presented here. Remember, Iâ€™m on a learning journey myself, and Iâ€™m only human. So, please consider the information here as a mere data point in your quest.

Iâ€™m always open to meeting new people (like you), so donâ€™t hesitate to drop me an email with the best book youâ€™ve recently read and whyâ€”itâ€™s a great conversation starter.

Thanks for reading, and I hope to talk to you soon! ðŸ˜Š
