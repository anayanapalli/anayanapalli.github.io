title: About Me
---

Hey there! Iâ€™m Anish, a Software Engineer with an insatiable curiosity for all things in life. When Iâ€™m not immersed in code, youâ€™ll find me lost in the pages of a book, taking a course, watching a documentary, or consuming some form of information.

Having called India, the US, and currently Canada home, my experiences have fueled a diverse range of thoughts, ideas, and beliefs. This blog is essentially a treasure trove, a digital sanctuary where I stow away ideas, thoughts, and invaluable learningsâ€”gems I find myself revisiting time and again.

The internet has been a generous source of knowledge for me, and this blog is my way of paying it forward. If even one person out there finds a nugget of useful information here, I consider the effort put into crafting this blog worthwhile.

Iâ€™ve learned a lot from the freely shared knowledge and experiences of others, and this is my humble attempt to contribute to the global pool of knowledge. Iâ€™m eager to engage with youâ€”whether you resonate with or challenge the ideas presented here. Remember, Iâ€™m on a perpetual learning journey myself, and Iâ€™m only human. So, please consider the information here as a guiding star, not an infallible rule.

Iâ€™m always open to meeting new interesting people, so donâ€™t hesitate to drop me an email with the best book youâ€™ve recently read and whyâ€”itâ€™s a great conversation starter.

Thanks for reading, and I hope to talk to you soon! ðŸ‘‹
