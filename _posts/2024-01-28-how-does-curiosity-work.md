## Introduction:

People often categorize themselves as either naturally curious or incurious, assuming it to be a fixed trait that they are born with. However, research tells a different story. In this blog post, we will delve into the essence of curiosity, to understand how it works and how we can harness its power to our advantage.

## What is Curiosity Anyway?

Consulting the dictionary, we find that curiosity is defined as *"a strong desire to know or learn something."* While this definition suffices, it fails to explain the mechanics behind curiosity or how we can leverage it effectively. Let's explore with a couple of examples. Consider these two questions:

- *Do you know about Deinonychus and where it was found?*
- *Do you know of a dinosaur whose fossil was found right in your state?*

Chances are, the first question failed to spark much curiosity unless you're a dinosaur expert. However, the second question likely piqued your interest significantly more. Why is that? This brings us to the concept of **"information gaps."**

**Information gaps** represent voids in our knowledge that our brains instinctively seek to fill, striving to complete the puzzle. If the gap is too vast, the topic may seem too novel to engage us. Similarly, if we possess exhaustive knowledge about a subject, curiosity dwindles as well. The sweet spot lies in the middle which we can call **"the curiosity zone"**, where emotional receptivity to learning is at its peak.

In essence, to be curious about a topic, one must possess foundational knowledge just enough to create an information gap which in turn fuels curiosity. Often, when individuals claim to be incurious, it's not because of a lack of curiosity but rather an absence of prerequisite knowledge to create an information gap that leads to curiosity.

## How to Utilize Information Gaps:

When striving to stimulate curiosity about a subject, start by creating an information gap. The simplest method is to see how the new information relates to your existing knowledge. *Metaphors and analogies often evoke "aha" moments by creating and filling in information gaps between your old and new knowledge.* Renowned authors like Agatha Christie strategically commence novels with scenes that create information gaps, keeping readers engaged and curious. The same goes with directors of movies and TV series, great professors, teachers and presenters in general.

## Conclusion:

Understanding how curiosity works empowers you to utilize information gaps effectively, fueling a continuous thirst for knowledge. By recognizing the relationship between existing knowledge and the desire for further understanding, you can cultivate curiosity and embark on a journey of joyful learning.
