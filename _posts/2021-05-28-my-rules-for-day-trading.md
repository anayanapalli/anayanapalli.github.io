title: My Rules for Day Trading
---

### 1. Only trade from 9:30 - 11:00 AM.

The market is the most active from 9:30 - 11:00 AM and the biggest and the most trending moves occur during these hours. After that activity slows down and trends don't persist as longer as stock movements are more erratic. It is better to trade with intense focus during the above hours and leave for the day than trading all day with waning attention. If you cannot make money during this period, most likely you won't be able to make money later in the day.

### 2. Short ONLY at peaks of rallies when the stock is at its weakest.

Always short ONLY at peaks of rallies, never at new lows. This makes sure that the risk-reward ratio of the trade is always to your advantage and protects you from abrupt reversals at the lows. Note that shorting at ANY other point is extremely risky and might cost you a lot of money.

### 3. Breakouts with long bases (created in the premarket) are good bets.

Breakout trades during these hours of trading are good bets as their success rate is quite high. One thing to keep in mind is that if the stock doesn't have a strong follow through after breaking out, most likely it will fall back into the trading range or break down further.

### 4. When you don't see a clear trend with strong moves stay out.

Remember that cash is a good position. It is not worth your time or money to assume risk trading a stock if the trend is not clear and strong. When in doubt stay out. It has been my experience that you lose more than you make by trading in these environments. Just relax, there will be many great days ahead. You can easily make a lot of money if you don't lose what you gained in the first place.

### 5. If you don't feel like trading DON'T trade (even if the market is very active).

You ONLY trade when you are mentally, physically and emotionally fit. Trading when you are not will make you do things that you will regret later. It is better to heed to this and engage in some other activity to keep you occupied.
