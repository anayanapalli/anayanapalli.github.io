The programmatic advertising ecosystem is often opaque even to many longtime engineers in the space. They work on a tiny subsystem—perhaps a bidding module, a dashboard, or a data enrichment pipeline—and never care to see the full ecosystem. Yet the system they are part of is well-designed, high-performance, real-time, and highly optimized, built to operate at scale with millisecond-level latency.

This post explains how programmatic adtech works, from the ground up, covering publishers, SSPs, Ad Exchanges, DSPs, CDPs, and ML pipelines.

Yes, it is a complex ecosystem kind of like the equity markets where there are so many players operating and there are so many details making the magic happen.

After reading this post you should have a pretty good idea of what exactly happens under the hood when you run programmatic ad campaigns. Probably you will be astounded by all the technology working to show your ad to audiences world wide.

So let me first start out by giving a real life scenario first to understand what programmatic Adtech really is about:

Let's say you put your favourite book in your amazon cart and didn't checkout for some reason and now you are reading a NYT post suddenly you see that items ad pop up on the website. How did that ad show up on the website? That is the product of programmatic adversiting by Amazon to to find you and remind you that there is an item that you want to buy and the question is how did Amazon find you and how quickly did it make a decision to show that add to you wherever you are online that is the magic of programmatic advertising so now I'm going to give the formal definition

So you just saw that the ad followed you, but there are a lot of players in the ecosystem behind that made this possible and first I'm going to name the players and then I'm going to give you the flow and don't be intimidated by the number of players cause once you see the flow everything fits into place as to what exactly they do so hang on

so the first players so the first first player is the publishers publishers are basically websites any digital property where you can show an ad that is what a publisher is it might be a website. It might be a mobile app. It might be what else is there it might be you know something like YouTube or Facebook whatever whatever it is so it might be it might be any digital asset that can show an ad to you so that's what a publisher is and the reason we call it. A publisher is because it publishes that a user arrived to an exchange, which is going to sell that ad space on that property so basically if you're looking at a blog, you have these two side pains you have these two sections right on the left on the right there. And the way company and the way publishers try to make money is by selling ads and now the question is how do they sell ads right? They sell ads with the help of SSP which are supply site platforms and the reason they're called supply site platforms is because they are the sources of supply of inventory inventory. Here is basically the impressions impressions of the inventory impression is basically a person sitting on a website for a few seconds or minutes whatever it is and that is what you're trying to monetize on the on the website an SSP is are the people who help these publishers make money

So the next players are SSB and SSP's are basically the people who help publishers make money and the way they do that is they provide the technology to these guys, which is basically a piece of code that they can you know that they can generate from their website and put it on their website, put it on the publisher website so whenever a user comes to their website or loads their website immediately there that code runs, which notifies that I user came and it takes the cookies and the cookie is basically a file that is generated by your browser to track whatever you saw before so previously if you were on Amazon Amazon knows that you know you are a person using XYZ cookie cause that's how you know you talk to browser over the Internet and preserve state basically state is a way to remember what you did before so Amazon knows that you are a person using this cookie and now when you visit this another publisher's website with the same cookie because cookies are all shared across the Internet. The publisher takes that cookie and goes to the SSP and says you know sell this guy sell the same sell the same impression and now the SSP what it does is DSSP is configured by the the SSP is configured by the publisher. The publisher says you know I want to sell an ad and I am only going to show an ad for $.50 or something like that so that's that that's the that's the floor that said by the publisher cause he's that's his property so he that's the minimum and now what happens as the SSP says OK you want $.50. I'll go to an exchange and see if I if there's anybody interested in this so they'll basically take this metadata goes to an ad exchange and an ad exchange is like a stock exchange. There might be multiple SSP's and there might be multiple DSP's now and now what is a DSP a DSP is basically a demand site. A demand site is a place where the advertisers are there and the advertisers of the people who are brands or you know, influencers or whoever that is was just trying to get you usually people who want to you know reach their clients so now they look at this cookie that they get from the SSP from the exchange and now they are going to tally that cookie and basically where did you get that cookie from Amazon knows because you're on their website you know that cookie this cookie belongs to a user and now you say but now again and where does ML come into the picture so Amazon is a very intelligent platform. They know how many people if if someone with a particular profile, let's say 32 years old, you know made $10,000 in purchases before and now has something in card if I show him once there's 90% probability of this guy buying it so now you're a very hype suspect so now it says like let's say the car value is 20 bucks now you calculate the value of the ad so it's like you know 90% so there's like 90% chance that you're going to win and it's like you know 20% and let's say the profit that you're going to make is $22 or $20 and now basically you can just multiply that and now you can say like you know I can bid anywhere from whatever that amount is and you know you come up with the floor and then you bid the price and usually it now at the and once you beat the immediately all the better scene and the highest bed goes and the example is let's say somebody bits one dollar 50 Cent and somebody beats $1.25 and somebody bits $1.15 now you're the highest bed and you win and usually the way these ads workers that highest bed is and usually the ads workers. The highest bed winner gets the second highest bed so and the reason they do it as just so you know the advertisers are not screwed right because when you place high when you place a high bed, you don't want to you don't wanna be screwed because if you if the advertisers are losing money or spending too much money and somebody else else's you know making less money you know the exchange is in efficient so that's why they use that second price that's like the typical defaulter defect. That's like the typical algorithm used in most art exchanges and now you got the air and once you get the once you won the ad, you're basically now OK this particular guy got the ad and now that ad has a URL in it and now the URL has the link to the ad from where you want to serve which is an ad server and that ad server is the place where you hosted your ad and then now it says you know, and then suddenly the court in the bro when when it gets a response, it taste like fetch this side and now once you fetch this ad, the art shows up on your website so this is the workflow what exactly happens here. It's it's very complex but all of this happens and just a few milliseconds and this is a high-performance system. Cause users are very quick. I mean people are moving very quickly they stay for a few seconds and they leave so you have to show the ad very quickly. If you're not showing the yard it's like a lost opportunity or if you're writing this algorithms poorly then you know marketers are losing money. Publishers are losing money if you're too slow, and if the exchange is slow, then you know then both these people are losing money cause you're not doing a good job of matching these two people so it's a very high-performance system and there's a lot of tech in it but this is at a very high-level what happens in in the ecosystem and now the players are DSP's SSP's add exchanges ad servers and publishers and you have advertisers and then CDP is like another piece of technology that these advertisers used to kind of like calculate these courses and that's how they basically you know run campaigns from so these are all the players here and if you look at like the very mature companies like Google Meta these guys they owned the whole stock right from the art exchange servers to the platforms the publishers to you know to the DSP's the SSP is the CD. It's like they own the whole stack. That's why these companies are so valuable and there are some other companies which only do the DSP there are some companies which only do the SSP there are some only art exchange servers so it's like you know it's a very fragmented marketplace, but it's very well interconnec so so in that way, you can reach people just by staying on one exchange you can pay everything is pluggable I can. It depends on what platform it is. Some of them are closed or not. Some of them are hybrid. Some of them are open to everything so it's like it's it's a very complex marketplace and every day billions of dollars are flowing through the system and and probably hundreds of billions of ads are being probably not hundreds of billions like billions of ads are showing for being shown across the Internet so this is a very complex system and it's a very interesting system especially if you're working at a start up that's doing some SSP work you know you're basically working on these data platforms that are feeding this whole ecosystem or at least a small part of the ecosystem so it's a very interesting phenomenon and hopefully you got a good idea and here's a flow diagram which kind of like shows what exactly happens and feel free to correct it
