## ðŸ“š Books That I Read (WIP)

### [Chip War: The Fight for the World's Most Critical Technology](https://www.amazon.ca/Chip-War-Worlds-Critical-Technology/dp/1982172002){:target="_blank"}
**Author:** Chris Miller **Rating:** 5.0/5.0 **Difficulty:** Intermediate

I've always wanted to understand more about the semiconductor industry as a whole because I have been dabbling with semiconductor stocks for a while, and I never really understood why some stocks went up, and others went down.

This book gives you all the information you need to understand the semiconductor industry holistically. The book covers economics, politics, and technologyâ€”a very interesting combination. The author has done an incredible job researching all the facts required to write a compelling book.

It not only provides insights into the semiconductor industry but also showcases how great human society is and how much technology and collaboration are involved in driving technological growth. It's truly inspiring. I highly recommend this book; it's a very important read.

If you want to understand the current state of geo-politics and technology, it's a fantastic readâ€”a solid five out of five. I was so excited after reading this book that I also gave a talk to my team on this topic.

### [The Billionaire's Apprentice: The Rise of The Indian-American Elite and The Fall of The Galleon Hedge Fund](https://www.amazon.ca/Billionaires-Apprentice-Indian-American-Elite-Galleon-ebook/dp/B008TUNLWM/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1JMGHOB71IMGN&keywords=the+billionaires+apprentice&qid=1703320349&sprefix=the+billionaires+apprentice%2Caps%2C100&sr=8-1){:target="_blank"}
**Author:** Anita Raghavan **Rating:** 5.0/5.0 **Difficulty:** Intermediate

I read this book twiceâ€”yes, it's that good. Growing up in India, Rajat Gupta was a role model for every kid who aspired to move to the US. He came from very humble beginnings and went on to become the CEO of one of the most prestigious companies in the world, McKinsey, which was a very white firm at the time. He exemplified that irrespective of one's origin, America accepts everybody and provides opportunities for everyone who works hard. It was genuinely disheartening to see that he was involved in the scandal. This book presents an unbiased view of all the events leading to the greatest insider trading scandal of our times.

The narrative unfolds with numerous immigrants who rose from humble beginnings to climb into the elitist echelons of society. Notable figures such as Raj Rajaratnam, a Sri Lankan immigrant, billionaire hedge fund manager, and Anil Kumar, a partner at McKinsey, contribute to the rich narrative. It's a story about many individuals and the repercussions when ambition goes too far.

Anita Raghavan's writing is exceptional. I've become a fan of hers and have even watched her interviews. She is incredible, and I eagerly await her future works. In my opinion, this is a solid, unequivocal five out of five book.

### [Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies](https://www.amazon.ca/Guns-Germs-Steel-Fates-Societies/dp/0393354326/ref=sr_1_1?crid=G9V5TJO44PR8&keywords=guns+germs+and+steel+book&qid=1703319699&s=books&sprefix=Guns+%2Cstripbooks%2C115&sr=1-1){:target="_blank"}
**Author:** Jared Diamond **Rating:** 4.0/5.0 **Difficulty:** Hard

Before reading this book, my perspective on developed countries rested on the belief that developed nations achieved their status due to the sophistication, intelligence, or drive of their inhabitants. However, this insightful read convincingly shatters that notion. The author skillfully unpacks the intricate web of external factors that influence the destiny of civilizations and countries.

The book doesn't merely highlight the why; it serves as a profound exploration into the nuanced reasons behind the advancement of certain countries and the lag experienced by others. It reshapes one's understanding of underdeveloped and developing nations in comparison to their advanced counterparts. The narrative underscores that a nation's progress is not solely determined by the attributes of its people but is profoundly influenced by the unique interplay of time, location, and a myriad of uncontrollable factors.

This exploration into the fate of different countries offers a compelling perspective, challenging pre-conceived notions and prompting readers to reconsider their understanding of societal development. It's a thought-provoking journey that transforms the way we perceive the global landscape.

Despite my appreciation for the book's ideas and its transformative impact on my worldview, I would rate it at 4.0 out of 5. The only drawback lies in the slightly challenging language, which might pose a hurdle for most readers. However, the originality of the ideas presented makes it a highly recommended and intellectually enriching read.

### [Thinking, Fast and Slow](https://www.amazon.ca/Thinking-Fast-Slow-Daniel-Kahneman/dp/0385676530/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3TRN60Y8EDGZO&keywords=Thinking+fast+and+slow&qid=1703323714&sprefix=thinking+fast+and+slow%2Caps%2C108&sr=8-1){:target="_blank"}
**Author:** Daniel Kahneman **Rating:** 4.5/5.0 **Difficulty:** Hard

If you've checked out Malcolm Gladwell's "Blink" think of this book as the godfather of that book. Daniel Kahneman, a big shot (He and Tversky invented the field of Behavioural Economics) in the field, a Nobel Prize winner, wrote this gem.

Now, a fair warning â€“ it's not a walk in the park. It's only for the persistent ones out there. I took my sweet time with it, picking it up and putting it down for a few months. But once you crack it open, you might feel like you've hit the jackpot and won't need a million other books on behavioral economics.

Kahneman's writing is crystal clear, and the way he explains stuff is mind-blowing. It really shows how deep his understanding is. So, if you've got the time, I'd totally recommend giving this book a go. It's written by one of the OGs in the field, and it's enlightening.

### [Made in Japan: Akio Morita and Sony](https://www.amazon.ca/Made-Japan-Akio-Morita-Sony/dp/0006383424/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2FOFX9BS6J9US&keywords=Akio+Morita&qid=1703325747&sprefix=akio+morita%2Caps%2C100&sr=8-1){:target="_blank"}
**Author:** Akio Morita **Rating:** 4.0/5.0 **Difficulty:** Easy

Sony is one of the very few Eastern technology companies that became highly successful in the West, challenging many big American companies in their own game. This book unfolds the story of Sony, narrated by the man himself, Akio Morita, the founder of Sony.

The narrative delves into Morita's beliefs, vision, and patriotism for Japan. It is fascinating to read and travel along as the story progresses, witnessing the small seedling's growth into the big corporate giant that Sony is today.

There's no brashness, no adoption of unfair means, and no flaunting of economic strength. Instead, it is a plain and simple story of a dreamer who dared to dream and succeeded. An inspiring read that offers a glimpse into the journey of a visionary entrepreneur.

This book gives us insight into the Japanese working ethos, their dedication, and commitment.
