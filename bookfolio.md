## ðŸ“š Books That I Read (WIP):

### [Chip War: The Fight for the World's Most Critical Technology](https://www.amazon.ca/Chip-War-Worlds-Critical-Technology/dp/1982172002){:target="_blank"}
**Author:** Chris Miller **Rating:** 5.0/5.0 **Difficulty:** Intermediate

I've always wanted to understand more about the semiconductor industry as a whole because I have been dabbling with semiconductor stocks for a while now, and I never really understood why some stocks went up, and others went down.

This book gives you all the information you need to understand the semiconductor industry holistically. The book covers economics, politics, and technologyâ€”a very interesting combination. The author has done an incredible job researching all the facts required to write a compelling book.

It not only provides insights into the semiconductor industry but also showcases how advanced human society is and how much technology and collaboration are involved in driving technological growth. It's truly inspiring. I highly recommend this book; it's a very important read during this time of AI craze.

If you want to understand the current state of geo-politics and technology, it's a fantastic readâ€”a solid five out of five. This is probably the best book that I read this year. I was so excited after reading this book that I also gave a talk to my team on this topic.

### [The Billionaire's Apprentice: The Rise of The Indian-American Elite and The Fall of The Galleon Hedge Fund](https://www.amazon.ca/Billionaires-Apprentice-Indian-American-Elite-Galleon-ebook/dp/B008TUNLWM/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1JMGHOB71IMGN&keywords=the+billionaires+apprentice&qid=1703320349&sprefix=the+billionaires+apprentice%2Caps%2C100&sr=8-1){:target="_blank"}
**Author:** Anita Raghavan **Rating:** 5.0/5.0 **Difficulty:** Intermediate

I read this book twiceâ€”yes, it's that good. Growing up in India, Rajat Gupta was a role model for every kid who aspired to move to the US. He came from very humble beginnings and went on to become the CEO of one of the most prestigious companies in the world, McKinsey, which was a very white firm at the time. He exemplified that irrespective of one's origin, America accepts everybody and provides opportunities for everyone who works hard. It was genuinely disheartening to see that he was involved in the scandal. This book presents an unbiased view of all the events leading to the greatest insider trading scandal of our times.

The narrative unfolds with numerous characters like Raj Rajaratnam, a Sri Lankan immigrant, billionaire hedge fund manager, and Anil Kumar, a partner at McKinsey, that contribute to the rich narrative. It's a story about many individuals and the repercussions when **ambition goes too far.**

Anita Raghavan's writing is gripping. I've become a fan of hers and have even watched her interviews. She is incredible, and I eagerly await her future works. In my opinion, this is a solid, unequivocal five out of five book.

### [Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies](https://www.amazon.ca/Guns-Germs-Steel-Fates-Societies/dp/0393354326/ref=sr_1_1?crid=G9V5TJO44PR8&keywords=guns+germs+and+steel+book&qid=1703319699&s=books&sprefix=Guns+%2Cstripbooks%2C115&sr=1-1){:target="_blank"}
**Author:** Jared Diamond **Rating:** 4.0/5.0 **Difficulty:** Hard

Before reading this book, I used to think that developed countries or civilizations were better than underdeveloped or developing countries because the people in the "developed" world were just better: more intelligent, more driven, more ambitious, etc. After reading this book, that perspective of mine is completely transformed. The author goes back in time and gives many examples as to why the West advanced more rapidly than the East, and they are mostly due to external factors like location, time, etc.

This is one of those perspective-transforming books, and I am glad that I read it. Giving it a 4.0 because I felt the language of the book was a bit too academic and hard to follow at times.

### [Thinking, Fast and Slow](https://www.amazon.ca/Thinking-Fast-Slow-Daniel-Kahneman/dp/0385676530/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3TRN60Y8EDGZO&keywords=Thinking+fast+and+slow&qid=1703323714&sprefix=thinking+fast+and+slow%2Caps%2C108&sr=8-1){:target="_blank"}
**Author:** Daniel Kahneman **Rating:** 4.5/5.0 **Difficulty:** Hard

If you've checked out Malcolm Gladwell's "Blink" think of this book as the godfather of that book. Daniel Kahneman, a big shot (He and Tversky invented the field of Behavioural Economics) in the field, a Nobel Prize winner, wrote this gem.

Now, a fair warning â€“ it's not a walk in the park. It's only for the persistent ones out there. I took my sweet time with it, picking it up and putting it down for a few months. But once you crack it open, you might feel like you've hit the jackpot and won't need a million other books on behavioral economics.

Kahneman's writing is crystal clear, and the way he explains stuff is mind-blowing. It really shows how deep his understanding is. So, if you've got the time, I'd totally recommend giving this book a go. It's written by one of the OGs in the field, and it's enlightening.

### [Stuff Matters: Exploring the Marvelous Materials That Shape Our Man-Made World](https://www.amazon.ca/Stuff-Matters-Exploring-Marvelous-Materials/dp/0544483944/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1703331963&sr=8-2){:target="_blank"}
**Author:** Mark Miodownik **Rating:** 4.5/5.0 **Difficulty:** Easy
 
If you hated Chemistry in high school, this book will make you fall in love with it. The author, a materials scientist, walks you through the materials we encounter daily, providing fascinating stories about their history, their atomic structure, their properties and their impact on humanity. It's intriguing to realize that we take these things for granted, not knowing the centuries of human work behind them. I really enjoyed the book, giving it a 4.5, as it gets a bit boring at times.
