<p><strong>Author:</strong> Chris Miller <strong>Rating:</strong> 5.0/5.0 <strong>Difficulty:</strong> Intermediate</p>

<p>I‚Äôve always wanted to understand more about the semiconductor industry as a whole because I have been dabbling with semiconductor stocks for a while, and I never really understood why some stocks went up, and others went down.</p>

<p>This book gives you all the information you need to understand the semiconductor industry holistically. The book covers economics, politics, and technology‚Äîa very interesting combination. The author has done an incredible job researching all the facts required to write a compelling book.</p>

<p>It not only provides insights into the semiconductor industry but also showcases how great human society is and how much technology and collaboration are involved in driving technological growth. It‚Äôs truly inspiring. I highly recommend this book; it‚Äôs a very important read.</p>

<p>If you want to understand the current state of geo-politics and technology, it‚Äôs a fantastic read‚Äîa solid five out of five. I was so excited after reading this book that I also gave a talk to my team on this topic.</p>

<p><strong>Author:</strong> Anita Raghavan <strong>Rating:</strong> 5.0/5.0 <strong>Difficulty:</strong> Intermediate</p>

<p>I read this book twice‚Äîyes, it‚Äôs that good. Growing up in India, Rajat Gupta was a role model for every kid who aspired to move to the US. He came from very humble beginnings and went on to become the CEO of one of the most prestigious companies in the world, McKinsey, which was a very white firm at the time. He exemplified that irrespective of one‚Äôs origin, America accepts everybody and provides opportunities for everyone who works hard. It was genuinely disheartening to see that he was involved in the scandal. This book presents an unbiased view of all the events leading to the greatest insider trading scandal of our times.</p>

<p>The narrative unfolds with numerous immigrants who rose from humble beginnings to climb into the elitist echelons of society. Notable figures such as Raj Rajaratnam, a Sri Lankan immigrant, billionaire hedge fund manager, and Anil Kumar, a partner at McKinsey, contribute to the rich narrative. It‚Äôs a story about many individuals and the repercussions when ambition goes too far.</p>

<p>Anita Raghavan‚Äôs writing is exceptional. I‚Äôve become a fan of hers and have even watched her interviews. She is incredible, and I eagerly await her future works. In my opinion, this is a solid, unequivocal five out of five book.</p>

<p><strong>Author:</strong> Jared Diamond <strong>Rating:</strong> 4.0/5.0 <strong>Difficulty:</strong> Hard</p>

<p>Before reading this book, my perspective on developed countries rested on the belief that developed nations achieved their status due to the sophistication, intelligence, or drive of their inhabitants. However, this insightful read convincingly shatters that notion. The author skillfully unpacks the intricate web of external factors that influence the destiny of civilizations and countries.</p>

<p>The book doesn‚Äôt merely highlight the why; it serves as a profound exploration into the nuanced reasons behind the advancement of certain countries and the lag experienced by others. It reshapes one‚Äôs understanding of underdeveloped and developing nations in comparison to their advanced counterparts. The narrative underscores that a nation‚Äôs progress is not solely determined by the attributes of its people but is profoundly influenced by the unique interplay of time, location, and a myriad of uncontrollable factors.</p>

<p>This exploration into the fate of different countries offers a compelling perspective, challenging pre-conceived notions and prompting readers to reconsider their understanding of societal development. It‚Äôs a thought-provoking journey that transforms the way we perceive the global landscape.</p>

<p>Despite my appreciation for the book‚Äôs ideas and its transformative impact on my worldview, I would rate it at 4.0 out of 5. The only drawback lies in the slightly challenging language, which might pose a hurdle for most readers. However, the originality of the ideas presented makes it a highly recommended and intellectually enriching read.</p>

<p><strong>Author:</strong> Daniel Kahneman <strong>Rating:</strong> 4.5/5.0 <strong>Difficulty:</strong> Hard</p>

<p>If you‚Äôve checked out Malcolm Gladwell‚Äôs ‚ÄúBlink‚Äù think of this book as the godfather of that book. Daniel Kahneman, a big shot (He and Tversky invented the field of Behavioural Economics) in the field, a Nobel Prize winner, wrote this gem.</p>

<p>Now, a fair warning ‚Äì it‚Äôs not a walk in the park. It‚Äôs only for the persistent ones out there. I took my sweet time with it, picking it up and putting it down for a few months. But once you crack it open, you might feel like you‚Äôve hit the jackpot and won‚Äôt need a million other books on behavioral economics.</p>

<p>Kahneman‚Äôs writing is crystal clear, and the way he explains stuff is mind-blowing. It really shows how deep his understanding is. So, if you‚Äôve got the time, I‚Äôd totally recommend giving this book a go. It‚Äôs written by one of the OGs in the field, and it‚Äôs enlightening.</p>

<p><strong>Author:</strong> Mark Miodownik <strong>Rating:</strong> 4.5/5.0 <strong>Difficulty:</strong> Easy</p>

<p>If you hated Chemistry in high school, this book will make you fall in love with it. The author, a materials scientist, walks you through the materials we encounter daily, providing fascinating stories about their history, their atomic structure, their properties and their impact on humanity. It‚Äôs intriguing to realize that we take these things for granted, not knowing the centuries of human work behind them. I really enjoyed the book, giving it a 4.5, as it gets a bit boring at times.</p>
