<p><strong>Author:</strong> Charles Wheelan <strong>Rating:</strong> 5.0/5.0 <strong>Difficulty:</strong> Intermediate</p>

<p>A very well-written book by an extremely knowledgeable policy expert. I have read and loved ‚ÄúNaked Economics,‚Äù and all I can say is that this book is even better. Charles has a knack for explaining complex topics in a way that even outsiders to the field can understand without watering down the content.</p>

<p>This book presents all the details about how money works: money vs. currency, what inflation and deflation are, how they affect the economy, historical case studies, the role of central banking, cryptocurrencies, euro vs. dollar, gold standard vs. fiat currencies, how exchange rates affect businessess and so much more.</p>

<p>I learned so much about economics, business, politics, etc., reading this book. The book is very readable for a 500+ page tome. I would highly recommend reading this book if any of the above topics interest you. This book is undoubtedly the <strong>best</strong> economics/money-related book that I ever read.</p>

<p><strong>Author:</strong> Paul Lockhart <strong>Rating:</strong> 5.0/5.0 <strong>Difficulty:</strong> Easy</p>

<p>This book is written by a passionate mathematician who is deeply concerned about the way math is taught in schools worldwide. He enlightens us on what math truly is about and how beautiful and intriguing it could be, if taught correctly.</p>

<p>He presents numerous problems and elegantly solves them from first principles, leaving us with an ‚Äúaha‚Äù moment once we arrive at their solutions.</p>

<p>After reading this book, I came to the realization that <a href="https://www.3blue1brown.com/" target="_blank">3Blue1Brown</a> is today‚Äôs Paul Lockhart.</p>

<p><strong>Author:</strong> Cal Newport <strong>Rating:</strong> 2.0/5.0 <strong>Difficulty:</strong> Easy</p>

<p>I read this book as part of a community that I‚Äôm running, and while there are some good takeaways in it, you don‚Äôt have to read the entire book to grasp those lessons.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm not particularly fond of books written by popular authors whose real work is in another domain (most of these work‚Äôs essense can be summarized in a blog post), and very rarely do I encounter ones that I find worthwhile. In my opinion, this book isn‚Äôt a good read.</p>

<p>You can learn all the important points just by watching a summary video.</p>

<p><strong>Author:</strong> Ken Watanabe <strong>Rating:</strong> 5.0/5.0 <strong>Difficulty:</strong> Easy</p>

<p>I was searching for a book to read related to consulting, as I‚Äôm currently working in that field. After sifting through a bunch of dull business books, I stumbled upon this awesome find. I am glad that I read it.</p>

<p>Though this book is intended for kids, I believe the frameworks and thought processes it presents are applicable across any domain and audience. I loved how the author presented concepts via an engaging story format.</p>

<p>Later, I  found out that many people at top-tier consulting firms have been recommending this book to their newly hired consultants. I highly recommend it to anyone seeking to learn how to tackle vague real-life problems systematically and rationally.</p>

<h3 id="chip-war-the-fight-for-the-worlds-most-critical-technology"><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Chip-War-Worlds-Critical-Technology/dp/1982172002" target="_blank">Chip War: The Fight for the World‚Äôs Most Critical Technology</a></h3>
<p><strong>Author:</strong> Chris Miller <strong>Rating:</strong> 5.0/5.0 <strong>Difficulty:</strong> Intermediate</p>

<p>I‚Äôve always wanted to understand more about the semiconductor industry as a whole because I have been dabbling with semiconductor stocks for a while now, and I never really understood why some stocks went up, and others went down.</p>

<p>This book provides all the information you need to understand the semiconductor industry holistically. It covers economics, politics, and technology‚Äîa very interesting combination. The author has done an incredible job researching all the facts required to write a compelling book.</p>

<p>The book offers insight into the great effort and cooperation involved among various scientists, engineers, companies, and countries in driving technological growth and solving complex engineering problems. It‚Äôs truly inspiring. I highly recommend this book; it‚Äôs a very important read during this time of AI craze.</p>

<p>If you want to understand the current state of geopolitics and the bleeding edge technology of semiconductors, it‚Äôs a fantastic read‚Äîa solid five out of five. This is probably <strong>the best book I‚Äôve read this year.</strong> I was so excited after reading this book that I also gave a talk to my team on this topic.</p>

<p><strong>Author:</strong> Anita Raghavan <strong>Rating:</strong> 5.0/5.0 <strong>Difficulty:</strong> Intermediate</p>

<p>I read this book twice‚Äîyes, it‚Äôs that good. Growing up in India, Rajat Gupta was a role model for every kid who aspired to move to the US. He came from very humble beginnings and went on to become the head of one of the most prestigious companies in the world, McKinsey, which was a very white firm at the time. He exemplified that irrespective of one‚Äôs origin, America accepts everybody and provides opportunities for everyone who works hard. It was genuinely disheartening to see that he was involved in the scandal. This book presents an unbiased view of all the events leading to the greatest insider trading scandal of our times.</p>

<p>The narrative unfolds with numerous characters like Raj Rajaratnam, a Sri Lankan immigrant, billionaire hedge fund manager, and Anil Kumar, a partner at McKinsey, that contribute to the rich narrative. It‚Äôs a story about many individuals and the repercussions when <strong>ambition goes too far.</strong></p>

<p>Anita Raghavan‚Äôs writing is gripping. I‚Äôve become a fan of hers and have even watched her interviews. She is incredible, and I eagerly await her future works. In my opinion, this is a solid, unequivocal five out of five book.</p>

<h3 id="made-in-japan-akio-morita-and-sony"><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Made-Japan-Akio-Morita-Sony/dp/0006383424/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2FOFX9BS6J9US&amp;keywords=Akio+Morita&amp;qid=1703325747&amp;sprefix=akio+morita%2Caps%2C100&amp;sr=8-1" target="_blank">Made in Japan: Akio Morita and Sony</a></h3>
<p><strong>Author:</strong> Akio Morita <strong>Rating:</strong> 4.0/5.0 <strong>Difficulty:</strong> Easy</p>

<p>Sony is one of the very few Eastern technology companies that became highly successful in the West, challenging many big American companies in their own game. This book unfolds the story of Sony, narrated by the man himself, Akio Morita, the founder of Sony.</p>

<p>The narrative delves into Morita‚Äôs beliefs, vision, and patriotism for Japan. It is fascinating to read and travel along as the story progresses, witnessing the small seedling‚Äôs growth into the big corporate giant that Sony is today.</p>

<p>There‚Äôs no brashness, no adoption of unfair means, and no flaunting of economic strength. Instead, it is a plain and simple story of a dreamer who dared to dream and succeeded. An inspiring read that offers a glimpse into the journey of a visionary entrepreneur.</p>

<p>This book gives us insight into the Japanese working ethos, their dedication, and commitment.</p>

<p><strong>P.S:</strong> I got interested in Mr. Morita after reading the book ‚ÄúChip War‚Äù as he was pivotal in putting Japan back on the world stage as a key player after WWII.</p>

<p><strong>Author:</strong> Mark Miodownik <strong>Rating:</strong> 4.5/5.0 <strong>Difficulty:</strong> Easy</p>

<p>If you hated Chemistry in high school, this book will make you fall in love with it. The author, a materials scientist, walks you through the materials we encounter daily, providing fascinating stories about their history, their atomic structure, their properties and their impact on humanity. It‚Äôs intriguing to realize that we take these things for granted, not knowing the centuries of human work behind them. I really enjoyed the book, giving it a 4.5, as it gets a bit boring at times.</p>

<h3 id="thinking-fast-and-slow"><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Thinking-Fast-Slow-Daniel-Kahneman/dp/0385676530/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3TRN60Y8EDGZO&amp;keywords=Thinking+fast+and+slow&amp;qid=1703323714&amp;sprefix=thinking+fast+and+slow%2Caps%2C108&amp;sr=8-1" target="_blank">Thinking, Fast and Slow</a></h3>
<p><strong>Author:</strong> Daniel Kahneman <strong>Rating:</strong> 4.5/5.0 <strong>Difficulty:</strong> Hard</p>

<p>If you‚Äôve checked out Malcolm Gladwell‚Äôs ‚ÄúBlink‚Äù think of this book as the godfather of that book. Daniel Kahneman, a big shot (He and Tversky invented the field of Behavioural Economics) in the field, a Nobel Prize winner, wrote this gem.</p>

<p>Now, a fair warning ‚Äì it‚Äôs not a walk in the park. It‚Äôs only for the persistent ones out there. I took my sweet time with it, picking it up and putting it down for a few months. But once you read this tome, you don‚Äôt have to read anything else on behavioral economics which are just rehashes of parts of this book.</p>

<p>Kahneman‚Äôs writing is crystal clear, and the way he explains stuff is mind-blowing. It really shows how deep his understanding is. So, if you‚Äôve got the time, I‚Äôd totally recommend giving this book a go. It‚Äôs written by one of the OGs in the field, and it‚Äôs enlightening.</p>

<p><strong>Author:</strong> Jared Diamond <strong>Rating:</strong> 4.0/5.0 <strong>Difficulty:</strong> Hard</p>

<p>Before reading this book, I used to think that developed countries or civilizations were better than underdeveloped or developing countries because the people in the ‚Äúdeveloped‚Äù world were just better: more intelligent, more driven, more ambitious, etc. After reading this book, that perspective of mine is completely transformed. The author goes back in time and gives many examples as to why the West advanced more rapidly than the East, and they are mostly due to external factors like location, time, etc.</p>

<p>This is one of those perspective-transforming books, and I am glad that I read it. Giving it a 4.0 because I felt the language of the book was a bit too academic and hard to follow at certain times.</p>

<p><strong>Author:</strong> Austin Kleon <strong>Rating:</strong> 4.0/5.0 <strong>Difficulty:</strong> Easy</p>

<p>If you‚Äôve hesitated to publish your work online, this book provides the nudge needed to transform your attitude and openly share and discuss your projects. It emphasizes that sharing your work is not about pursuing perfection but rather a valuable tool for networking and continuous learning.</p>

<p>Filled with valuable insights, it‚Äôs a quick read that I highly recommend to anyone contemplating the reasons to share their work. Personally, this book inspired me to start my blog.</p>

<p>Its brevity allows you to complete it within a few hours, making it a truly worthwhile read.</p>

<h3 id="ai-superpowers-china-silicon-valley-and-the-new-world-order"><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/AI-Superpowers-China-Silicon-Valley/dp/0358105587/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2MWDP3MMIBG&amp;keywords=ai+superpowers&amp;qid=1704165739&amp;sprefix=AI+Su%2Caps%2C80&amp;sr=8-1" target="_blank">AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley, and the New World Order</a></h3>
<p><strong>Author:</strong> Kai-Fu Lee <strong>Rating:</strong> 4.5/5.0 <strong>Difficulty:</strong> Easy</p>

<p>This is a good book, despite some inaccuracies in its predictions. It guides readers in the right direction, with a keen focus on the profound influence of AI on our future. The author, a leading AI researcher turned venture capitalist, provides a clear and insightful explanation of the subject and its implications.</p>

<p>At its core, the book revolves around the premise that data, technology, and AI-rich countries like the United States and China will hold a substantial advantage in the AI-led future. The author substantiates this idea through a wealth of studies and predictions, exploring the potential impacts on various fields, job disruptions, and the overall transformation of life with the ascent of AI.</p>

<p>What sets this book apart are the multitude of great ideas and intriguing thoughts presented by the author. The narrative not only effectively elucidates the potential of artificial intelligence but also adds a human touch to the discussion. The exploration of the Chinese startup ecosystem, the Chinese government‚Äôs support and vision, and the ferocious competition in Chinese markets provides valuable insights into the rapid AI adoption in China.</p>

<p>In summary, I found this to be a pretty good read. It not only delves into the exciting possibilities of AI but also offers a thoughtful examination of its potential impact on our lives.</p>
