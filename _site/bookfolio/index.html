<h3 id="chip-war-the-fight-for-the-worlds-most-critical-technology"><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Chip-War-Worlds-Critical-Technology/dp/1982172002" target="_blank">Chip War: The Fight for the Worldâ€™s Most Critical Technology</a></h3>
<p><strong>Author:</strong> Chris Miller <strong>Rating:</strong> 5.0/5.0 <strong>Difficulty:</strong> Intermediate</p>

<p align="justify">
I've always wanted to understand more about the semiconductor industry as a whole because I have been dabbling with semiconductor stocks for a while now, and I never really understood why some stocks went up, and others went down.
</p>

<p align="justify">
This book provides all the information you need to understand the semiconductor industry holistically. It covers economics, politics, and technologyâ€”a very interesting combination. The author has done an incredible job researching all the facts required to write a compelling book.
</p>

<p align="justify">
The book offers insight into the great effort and cooperation involved among various scientists, engineers, companies, and countries in driving technological growth and solving complex engineering problems. Itâ€™s truly inspiring. I highly recommend this book; itâ€™s a very important read during this time of AI craze.
</p>

<p align="justify">
If you want to understand the current state of geopolitics and the bleeding edge technology of semiconductors, itâ€™s a fantastic readâ€”a solid five out of five. This is probably <b>the best book I've read this year.</b> I was so excited after reading this book that I also gave a talk to my team on this topic.
</p>

<p><strong>Author:</strong> Anita Raghavan <strong>Rating:</strong> 5.0/5.0 <strong>Difficulty:</strong> Intermediate</p>

<p align="justify">
I read this book twiceâ€”yes, it's that good. Growing up in India, Rajat Gupta was a role model for every kid who aspired to move to the US. He came from very humble beginnings and went on to become the head of one of the most prestigious companies in the world, McKinsey, which was a very white firm at the time. He exemplified that irrespective of one's origin, America accepts everybody and provides opportunities for everyone who works hard. It was genuinely disheartening to see that he was involved in the scandal. This book presents an unbiased view of all the events leading to the greatest insider trading scandal of our times.
</p>

<p align="justify">
The narrative unfolds with numerous characters like Raj Rajaratnam, a Sri Lankan immigrant, billionaire hedge fund manager, and Anil Kumar, a partner at McKinsey, that contribute to the rich narrative. It's a story about many individuals and the repercussions when <b>ambition goes too far.</b>
</p>

<p align="justify">
Anita Raghavan's writing is gripping. I've become a fan of hers and have even watched her interviews. She is incredible, and I eagerly await her future works. In my opinion, this is a solid, unequivocal five out of five book.
</p>

<h3 id="made-in-japan-akio-morita-and-sony"><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Made-Japan-Akio-Morita-Sony/dp/0006383424/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2FOFX9BS6J9US&amp;keywords=Akio+Morita&amp;qid=1703325747&amp;sprefix=akio+morita%2Caps%2C100&amp;sr=8-1" target="_blank">Made in Japan: Akio Morita and Sony</a></h3>
<p><strong>Author:</strong> Akio Morita <strong>Rating:</strong> 4.0/5.0 <strong>Difficulty:</strong> Easy</p>

<p align="justify">
Sony is one of the very few Eastern technology companies that became highly successful in the West, challenging many big American companies in their own game. This book unfolds the story of Sony, narrated by the man himself, Akio Morita, the founder of Sony.
</p>

<p align="justify">
The narrative delves into Morita's beliefs, vision, and patriotism for Japan. It is fascinating to read and travel along as the story progresses, witnessing the small seedling's growth into the big corporate giant that Sony is today.
</p>

<p align="justify">
There's no brashness, no adoption of unfair means, and no flaunting of economic strength. Instead, it is a plain and simple story of a dreamer who dared to dream and succeeded. An inspiring read that offers a glimpse into the journey of a visionary entrepreneur.
</p>

<p align="justify">
This book gives us insight into the Japanese working ethos, their dedication, and commitment.
</p>

<p align="justify">
<b>P.S:</b> I got interested in Mr. Morita after reading the book "Chip War" as he was pivotal in putting Japan back on the world stage as a key player after WWII.

<p><strong>Author:</strong> Mark Miodownik <strong>Rating:</strong> 4.5/5.0 <strong>Difficulty:</strong> Easy</p>

<p align="justify">
If you hated Chemistry in high school, this book will make you fall in love with it. The author, a materials scientist, walks you through the materials we encounter daily, providing fascinating stories about their history, their atomic structure, their properties and their impact on humanity. It's intriguing to realize that we take these things for granted, not knowing the centuries of human work behind them. I really enjoyed the book, giving it a 4.5, as it gets a bit boring at times.
</p>

<h3 id="thinking-fast-and-slow"><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Thinking-Fast-Slow-Daniel-Kahneman/dp/0385676530/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3TRN60Y8EDGZO&amp;keywords=Thinking+fast+and+slow&amp;qid=1703323714&amp;sprefix=thinking+fast+and+slow%2Caps%2C108&amp;sr=8-1" target="_blank">Thinking, Fast and Slow</a></h3>
<p><strong>Author:</strong> Daniel Kahneman <strong>Rating:</strong> 4.5/5.0 <strong>Difficulty:</strong> Hard</p>

<p align="justify">
If you've checked out Malcolm Gladwell's "Blink" think of this book as the godfather of that book. Daniel Kahneman, a big shot (He and Tversky invented the field of Behavioural Economics) in the field, a Nobel Prize winner, wrote this gem.
</p>

<p align="justify">
Now, a fair warning â€“ it's not a walk in the park. It's only for the persistent ones out there. I took my sweet time with it, picking it up and putting it down for a few months. But once you read this tome, you don't have to read anything else on behavioral economics which are just rehashes of parts of this book.
</p>

<p align="justify">
Kahneman's writing is crystal clear, and the way he explains stuff is mind-blowing. It really shows how deep his understanding is. So, if you've got the time, I'd totally recommend giving this book a go. It's written by one of the OGs in the field, and it's enlightening.
</p>

<p><strong>Author:</strong> Jared Diamond <strong>Rating:</strong> 4.0/5.0 <strong>Difficulty:</strong> Hard</p>

<p align="justify">
Before reading this book, I used to think that developed countries or civilizations were better than underdeveloped or developing countries because the people in the "developed" world were just better: more intelligent, more driven, more ambitious, etc. After reading this book, that perspective of mine is completely transformed. The author goes back in time and gives many examples as to why the West advanced more rapidly than the East, and they are mostly due to external factors like location, time, etc.
</p>

<p align="justify">
This is one of those perspective-transforming books, and I am glad that I read it. Giving it a 4.0 because I felt the language of the book was a bit too academic and hard to follow at certain times.
</p>

<h3 id="show-your-work-10-ways-to-share-your-creativity-and-get-discovered"><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Show-Your-Work-Creativity-Discovered/dp/076117897X/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3FEYDNGCGCKIL&amp;keywords=show+your+work+austin+kleon&amp;qid=1704164941&amp;sprefix=Show+your+work%2Caps%2C81&amp;sr=8-1" target="_blank">Show Your Work!: 10 Ways to Share Your Creativity and Get Discovered</a></h3>
<p><strong>Author:</strong> Austin Kleon <strong>Rating:</strong> 4.0/5.0 <strong>Difficulty:</strong> Easy</p>

<p align="justify">
If you've hesitated to publish your work online, this book provides the nudge needed to transform your attitude and openly share and discuss your projects. It emphasizes that sharing your work is not about pursuing perfection but rather a valuable tool for networking and continuous learning.
</p>

<p align="justify">
Filled with valuable insights, it's a quick read that I highly recommend to anyone contemplating the reasons to share their work. Personally, this book inspired me to start my blog.
</p>

<p align="justify">
Its brevity allows you to complete it within a few hours, making it a truly worthwhile read.
</p>

<h3 id="ai-superpowers-china-silicon-valley-and-the-new-world-order"><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/AI-Superpowers-China-Silicon-Valley/dp/0358105587/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2MWDP3MMIBG&amp;keywords=ai+superpowers&amp;qid=1704165739&amp;sprefix=AI+Su%2Caps%2C80&amp;sr=8-1" target="_blank">AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley, and the New World Order</a></h3>
<p><strong>Author:</strong> Kai-Fu Lee <strong>Rating:</strong> 4.5/5.0 <strong>Difficulty:</strong> Easy</p>

<p align="justify">
This is a good book, despite some inaccuracies in its predictions. It guides readers in the right direction, with a keen focus on the profound influence of AI on our future. The author, a leading AI researcher turned venture capitalist, provides a clear and insightful explanation of the subject and its implications.
</p>

<p align="justify">
At its core, the book revolves around the premise that data, technology, and AI-rich countries like the United States and China will hold a substantial advantage in the AI-led future. The author substantiates this idea through a wealth of studies and predictions, exploring the potential impacts on various fields, job disruptions, and the overall transformation of life with the ascent of AI.
</p>

<p align="justify">
What sets this book apart are the multitude of great ideas and intriguing thoughts presented by the author. The narrative not only effectively elucidates the potential of artificial intelligence but also adds a human touch to the discussion. The exploration of the Chinese startup ecosystem, the Chinese government's support and vision, and the ferocious competition in Chinese markets provides valuable insights into the rapid AI adoption in China.
</p>

<p align="justify">
In summary, I found this to be a pretty good read. It not only delves into the exciting possibilities of AI but also offers a thoughtful examination of its potential impact on our lives.
