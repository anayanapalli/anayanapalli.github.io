  <h1 class="post-title">Top Five Signs of a Topping Market</h1>
  <span class="post-date">26 May 2021</span>
  <p>The following are the top five signs that might help you identify market tops. Note that market tops take a while (a few months to a few years) to form depending on the extent of the previous bull run. The more of the following signs you see, the higher the probability that you are looking at a market top.</p>

<p>So with that said lets dive in:</p>

<h3 id="1-the-most-active-stocks-that-led-the-long-bull-run-stop-making-new-highs">1. The most active stocks that led the long bull run stop making new highs.</h3>

<p>We all have experienced the periods during which almost all the stocks start making new highs every week; this is a very good sign that a new bull market has begun. But as time progresses, we start to see that the stocks that doubled, tripled, quadrupled don’t seem to make new highs as they used to before (because of the selling involved). When this happens in most of the leading stocks then most likely the bull run is over or near its end.</p>

<h3 id="2-fewer-and-fewer-stocks-continue-to-make-new-highs">2. Fewer and fewer stocks continue to make new highs.</h3>

<p>Another vital sign that might signify a market top is that fewer and fewer stocks are making new highs and most of these stocks (that are making new highs) are mostly blue-chip stocks that have a strong influence on the widely tracked market indexes. This is an age-old tactic used by big fund managers to make the public believe that the market is still doing well while they start liquidating their positions in the stocks that had had huge runs. It is just a matter of time that the whole market tumbles.</p>

<h3 id="3-most-breakouts-fail-and-the-few-that-succeed-do-so-on-very-low-volume">3. Most breakouts fail and the few that succeed do so on very low volume.</h3>

<p>As most of the buying power (which created the incredible bull run in the first place) is already used up, less and less money is available to pour into the stock market. And the money that is coming in is not in the same amount as it was before. Always remember that breakout volume peaks mid-way. The fact that you are seeing breakouts fail and those that are succeeding are doing so on very low volume is a very clear sign that you are late to the party and there’s much less conviction behind the move ahead.</p>

<h3 id="4-analysts-start-giving-high-price-targets-to-stocks-that-have-already-had-incredible-runs">4. Analysts start giving high price targets to stocks that have already had incredible runs.</h3>

<p>We all have seen those mind-boggling price targets by analysts predicting that a stock could double again, after it doubled five times before recently. Even though there’s a very good probability that stocks that have doubled tend to double further on, we would recommend to watch out for strength in the stock (how well it is holding up compared to the rest of the market and if it is making new highs with ease) before you make your purchase. If the stock is going down after releasing these price targets then most likely it was a campaign by some hedge fund or a big investor to unload a lot of stock at high prices to gullible investors.</p>

<h3 id="5-the-volatility-of-the-market-as-a-whole-increases-a-lot">5. The volatility of the market as a whole increases a lot.</h3>

<p>Extreme volatility is a sign of emotional activity in the stock market whether it is on the up or the down side. Generally if a stock is making extreme moves at a pace unprecedented before it is a sign that general public is the one that’s involved the most. And the time when most of the people are in a buying frenzy is the best time to sell not buy. Remember that the hedge funds and other institutions that got in early are selling into this strength at insanely high prices while the general public is buying anxiously.</p>
