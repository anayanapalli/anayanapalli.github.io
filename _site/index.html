<p align="justify">So...I recently started a community within my company and I learnt a lot of things in the process. Maybe you are passionate about a particular topic, or you're eager to help others, but you're not quite sure where to begin. Well then, this post might be of some help to you.</p>

<p align="justify">Here's the list of things that I learnt in the process of starting a community:</p>

<h2 id="1-good-and-bad-reasons-to-start-a-community">1. Good and Bad Reasons to Start a Community</h2>
<p align="justify">Let's get one thing straight from the get-go: there are good reasons and bad reasons to start a community.</p>

<h3 id="bad-reasons">Bad Reasons</h3>
<p align="justify">If you're in it to boost your ego, gain fame, or just for the sake of having a huge following, you might want to rethink your motivations.</p>

<h3 id="good-reasons">Good Reasons</h3>
<p align="justify">However, if you're genuinely passionate about a topic or a cause and you can't bear the thought of the absence of a community for it, then you're on the right track.</p>

<h2 id="2-passion-initiative-and-embracing-failure">2. Passion, Initiative, and Embracing Failure</h2>
<p align="justify">Starting a community isn't for the faint of heart. It takes passion, initiative, and most importantly a willingness to fail publicly. Yes, you heard me right. Embracing the possibility of failure in front of everyone is a crucial litmus test for your commitment.</p>

<h2 id="3-the-power-of-the-first-post">3. The Power of the First Post</h2>
<p align="justify">Your first post is like your community's first impression. Make it count. From my experience, a conversational tone works wonders. People want to connect with real humans, not faceless corporations.</p>

<h2 id="4-the-importance-of-your-first-members">4. The Importance of Your First Members</h2>
<p align="justify">Those initial members? They're your tribe. They're the ones who truly care about what you're building. Pay attention to them; take care of them. They are your biggest supporters.</p>

<h2 id="5-understanding-your-community">5. Understanding Your Community</h2>
<p align="justify">The best way to understand what your community wants is to ask them. It's as simple as that. Forget the notion that people don't know what they want until you show them. We are not building a high tech startup here. Your community knows best.</p>

<h2 id="6-addressing-drop-offs">6. Addressing Drop-Offs</h2>
<p align="justify">If people are dropping off, don't just throw more marketing at the problem. Take a step back and figure out why. Fix the root cause, not just the symptoms.</p>

<h2 id="7-quality-over-quantity">7. Quality Over Quantity</h2>
<p align="justify">A small, tight-knit community beats a massive, indifferent one any day. It's not about the numbers; it's about the connections you forge.</p>

<h2 id="8-the-journey-is-the-reward">8. The Journey Is the Reward</h2>
<p align="justify">Starting a community isn't just about the destination; it's about the journey. Along the way, you'll learn a lot about people, influence, marketing, leadership and so much more. Trust me; it's worth it.</p>

<p align="justify">In conclusion, starting a community is not easy. But if you're willing to put in the effort and take a small risk, the rewards can be truly fulfilling, even if they are tiny.</p>
